Script for cleaning up old analysis nextflow projects

The script will list folders (with full path) that will be deleted and calculate how much data will be removed.
It will wait for input from user before removing anything.

Usage:
cd /path/to/analysis/project
python /path/to/script/folder/cleanup_nf_projects.py
